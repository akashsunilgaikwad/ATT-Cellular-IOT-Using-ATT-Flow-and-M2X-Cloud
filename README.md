# ATT-Cellular-IOT-Using-ATT-Flow-and-M2X-Cloud
Project involved designing of custom sensor bus PCB to interface various sensor click boards to the FRDM K64F micro-controller, and to send the data to the cloud.  Wrote firmware source code to interface the sensors like temperature, humidity, pressure, ambient light sensor, thermocouple.  Integration of fingerprint sensor to add security &amp; GUI for local Monitoring.  Stored the sensor data locally and in M2X cloud using AT&amp;T flow as cloud computation platform.  Configured the Tigger node to send SMS alert using Twilio API in case of High and Low temperature.
You can use MCUxpresso or gnuarmeclipse platform to Compile and debug the above code.
